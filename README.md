# LexiaPowerUp XSS vulnerability (discovered by rare1k )
* You can use the `logoutUrl` url parameter to execute arbitrary JavaScript code (such as bookmarklets), and there's virtually no type of CSP
* When you try it, it will give an error, click "Return to Login" to trigger the XSS code <br>
Example: https://www.lexiapowerup.com/?siteId=_&logoutUrl=%6A%61%76%61%73%63%72%69%70%74%3A%61%6C%65%72%74%28%27%72%65%61%6C%27%29 <br>
**Note**: `siteId` can be anything, from ~~pornhub~~ your own fucking site to your discord server.
* You may need to percent encode the entire code snipper, go to 
<https://onlinetexttools.com/url-encode-text> and paste in the code and click Escape All Text Characters for it to work properly, then paste the output into the URL
